# FaultfieldApp
MATLAB App Designer–based simulator for modeling electric field, potential, and current flow in soil due to underground cable ground faults.
📌 Overview
FaultEFieldApp is an interactive MATLAB App Designer–based tool developed to simulate and visualize the electric field and electric potential distribution around an underground cable fault.
The application helps in understanding how fault current spreads through soil and how electric field intensity varies with distance, soil properties, and fault parameters.
This project bridges basic field theory concepts with practical power engineering applications, making it suitable for students, educators, and researchers.

🎯 Motivation
Underground cable faults inject large currents into the surrounding soil, creating dangerous voltage gradients that can lead to step and touch voltage hazards.
However, these effects are often difficult to visualize using equations alone.
This project was developed to:
•	Convert abstract field-theory equations into clear visual plots
•	Help students understand current spreading and electric field behavior
•	Provide an interactive learning tool for grounding and fault analysis

🧠 Core Concept
When a ground fault occurs:
•	Fault current flows from the cable into the soil
•	Soil, being resistive, causes voltage to drop with distance
•	This voltage gradient produces an electric field
•	The electric field is strongest near the fault and weakens with distance
The app models this behavior using quasi-static field theory assumptions and standard grounding equations.

🧮 Theoretical Basis
The simulation is based on:
•	Ohm’s law for fault current estimation
•	Current spreading in homogeneous soil
•	Relationship between electric field and potential
Key relationships used:
•	Electric field decreases inversely with distance from the fault
•	Electric potential varies logarithmically with distance
•	Field direction follows the voltage gradient
These assumptions are commonly used in grounding and earthing studies.
